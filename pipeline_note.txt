Key Points
Branch Triggering & Conditions:

The pipeline triggers on commits to dev and release branches.

The DEV stage runs only if the source branch is refs/heads/dev.

Both the E2E and QA stages run when the source branch is refs/heads/release. (QA depends on E2E.)

Variable Templates:

Each stage loads its environment‑specific variables from an external file (e.g., vars/vars_dev.yaml for DEV, etc.).

These files define values such as helmChartFile, helmValuesFile, namespace, kubernetesServiceConnection, SecretProviderClass, and agentPool.

Token Replacement for Secrets:

The ReplaceTokens task scans your values file for tokens (for example, #{DB_PASSWORD}#) and replaces them with secret values from the variable group (linked to Azure Key Vault).

Azure DevOps Environments:

For non‑DEV stages, the stage is bound to an Azure DevOps environment (E2E and QA). Configure these environments in your DevOps project to enforce manual approvals if required.

This YAML will work as follows:

A commit to the dev branch automatically triggers the Deploy_Exstream_Dev stage, which picks up settings from vars/vars_dev.yaml and deploys to the DEV environment.

A commit to the release branch triggers the E2E stage (and then the QA stage), picking the proper values files and secrets as defined in vars/vars_e2e.yaml and vars/vars_qa.yaml respectively.
